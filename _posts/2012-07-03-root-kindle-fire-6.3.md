I recently wrote a post on rooting your Kindle Fire 6.2.2 on your mac. You can read the post [here](http://pradeepnayak.in/Hacks/2012/03/03/Root-Kindle-Fire-mac/). Apparently that process no longer works for the new firmware 6.3. To root your Kindle Fire with firmware 6.3, follow the steps below

* Download the Kindle Water App from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y6asvws010fzfx2/9zImeW64pm/KindleWater.app)
* Connect your Kindle Fire to your mac via micro USB cable
* Launch the KindleWater app, and just follow the instructions it says.
* Within the next few minutes your Kindle would be rooted :)

Please note that Kindle Water will also install the [ClockWorkMod](http://www.clockworkmod.com/) Recovery Manager. Dont be surprised if you see a fire like icon at boot.

To install the Android Market, just follow the instructions which are listed in the previous [post](http://pradeepnayak.in/Hacks/2012/03/03/Root-Kindle-Fire-mac/)

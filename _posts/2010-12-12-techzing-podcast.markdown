<p>As web developers, we like to try to keep up to date with what's happening in the industry, share stories and find out what people are up to. Working from home can limit the exposure to like-minded individuals, and one of the best ways to make up for this is podcasts.</p>

<p>There are a wealth of podcasts covering everything from technology news, web platform specific discussion, start-ups and more, but the one we keep coming back to is <a href="http://www.techzinglive.com">Techzing</a>.</p>

<p>Run by Justin Vincent and Jason Roberts, the show combines a laid-back discussion style in which they discuss any industry news along with their own web projects, and industry interviews where they bring in a wide variety of interesting and informed guests to discuss what they do.</p>

<p>Justin's project <a href="http://pluggio.com/">Pluggio</a>, and Jason's <a href="http://www.appignite.com/">AppIgnite</a> are often discussed, and the two share insights as what works or doesn't work when it comes to setting up and promoting an online software service.</p>

<p>By sharing their own experiences in a frank and engaging manner, the show manages to stay light and personal and keeps the discussions lively and fun. Check it out!</p>

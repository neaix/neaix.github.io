I am often asked this question on how I am able to find time to do so many things. Work, Travel, Food, Adventure, Photography I do them all. My answer is simple, we are here for a short period of time and we have to make sure you make best use of it. 

<br/>
I am just listing few things which you should consider doing if you aren't doing it already. The list below is randomly ordered. I have noted them down as and when it came to my tiny little brain.

* **Travel**. Seriously as much as you can. You meet new people, experience different cultures and food.

* **Cooking**. Trust me, it's the best stress reliever. If you don't know to cook, then learn it. You will get to enjoy food more and the company that comes with it.

* **Read**. As much as you can. There are a lot of amazing books out there. You can relate to a lot of topics.

* **Savings**. I am so damn proud of my father. He paid for all my education till I finished my undergraduate studies. One simple he told me once I started working, learn to save atleast 40% of your income. So Save.

* **Love the Outdoors**. The more you are out and away from your desk, the greater the chance of enjoying life and meeting up with people(accidentally and/or by choice).

* **Food/Beverages**. Learn, experiment, try out, taste all different types of foods. You eat 3 times a day if not more. Everyone on Earth follows the same routine, get to know food and you can break the ice in so many situations. Besides, its very tasty! For the record, I am a big time foodie!

* **Do what you Love**. If you do what you love, then trust me everything else will automatically follow. Fame, money, success.

* **NO**. Learn to say NO. The earlier on in life you master this trait, the better of you will be. It may be a sour thing to do, but you will feel better afterwards. Most people hesitate or are too courteous to say No, and end up burdening themselves.

> Finally. Life is a sport. Make it Count.

[THON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Dance_Marathon)是每年二月都会举行的[Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Marathon) (直译为PennState跳舞马拉松)的简称，目的是为抗击儿童癌症募集资金。

今年的活动从昨天下午六点开始，连续不断持续46小时。在这46个小时中，700位报名参加跳舞的同学会和现场观众一起每隔一小时会将一个主题舞蹈即Line Dance跳一遍。Line Dance之间DJ会播放各种舞曲，现场所有人会跟着节奏自娱自乐。偶尔会有嘉宾客串节目。现场气氛非常的热烈并且持续两天！

今年这个活动已经是第36届了，也许不少人会怀疑这样的活动更多的是为了娱乐和狂欢，可Thon 2007的募集资金是<strong>5240385</strong>美金！相信比很多所谓慈善演出的募集资金都要高的多。

今天晚上和azalea在现场跟着跳了三遍Line Dance，不过还是没学会。歌词也很有意思，穿插了不少流行东西，比如：" Grab your iPhone, Make a call"，"Harry Potter cast a spell", 强烈建议听一下。十二点左右离去，不过仍有不少人陆续进场，今晚继续是个不眠之夜。

目前这次活动离结束还有14个多小时，在<a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/news_specials/08thon/photos.aspx">这里</a>可以看到最新的现场图片。<a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/blogs/thon/" target="_blank">这里</a>是文字版的现场转播。<a href="http://azaleasays.com/2008/02/24/thonpictures/">这里</a>是azalea的记录。

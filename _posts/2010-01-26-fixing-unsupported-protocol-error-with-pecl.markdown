After setting up PHP 5.2.10, I wanted to install a few additional modules using PECL. I found soon after that I was unable to do so, receiving the following error:

<blockquote>pear.php.net is using a unsupported protocol - This should never happen. install failed</blockquote>

The problem seems to exhibit itself with corrupted PEAR installations in PHP 5.2.9 and 5.2.10. To fix this, just backup and update the channels:

{% highlight bash %}
mv /usr/local/lib/php/.channels /usr/local/lib/php/.channels.bak
pear update-channels
{% endhighlight %}

After that, you should be good to go.

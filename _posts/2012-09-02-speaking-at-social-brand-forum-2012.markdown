On October 17-18, I'll be giving a talk at <a href="http://branddrivensocial.com/socialbrand2012/" target="_new" rel="external">Social Brand Forum 2012</a>, Iowaâ€™s premier social media marketing event. The session is centered around how businesses can successfully manage a crisis with social media, focusing on the impact of customer relationships and brand reputation. I'm thrilled to be part of such a great event.

Social Brand Forum 2012 brings national-level social media content to the Eastern Iowa Creative Corridor for a day and half of keynotes, panel discussions, and interactive sessions. Featuring speakers, authors, and thought leaders from the national stage, the event is designed to help marketers at organizations small and large build stronger brands through social media content, conversations, and community.

## Brief account of Samaradhana

During any religious worship, ritual it is a custom among Hindus to offer food to the Lord in the form of Naivedyam and the same is distributed among the devotees in the form of Prasada in the form of Samaradhana, meaning equal consumption of the Prasada by all the devotees. Samaradhana in which luscious and mouth watering dishes are served, is an integral part of Kodial Teru. Men of all ages enthusiastically volunteer to serve adorned with elegant Patte Todapu, which is mandatory for all volunteers who wish to serve Samaradhana during Kodial Teru.

On first and third day, chane gashi, kuvale sasam, govan kane godshe are the special items. On second and fourth day tori gashi, duddhe upkari form the main dishes. Chane dali godshe and khichidi will served on second and fourth day respectively. Chithranna is the main attraction on Mrigabete. On Hodu Teru chane gashi, kuvale puli koddel and Madgane form the Samaradhana. Apart from this rice,saru and the very famous dalithoy are the common items on all the five days.


The kitchen is closed in all the G.S.B houses during this festival and you can find people in thousands gathered at Car Street to enjoy the festival. The fourth and the fifth day of the festival is typically the most crowded days. You can find people in numbers upto 25,000 at Car Street. You can see many ladies sporting expensive jewlerry and colorful sarees, Men in simple Dhoti and Shirts, Volunteers in Patte Todapu. 

Hence, Kodial Teru is one such mega fiesta that any G.S.B(Gowda Saraswath Brahmin) would never choose to skip, howsoever absorbed they be with their schedule. And accordingly Lord Veera Venkatesha Swamy has been utmost gracious to all the devotees who had been a part of his Rathotsava, by bestowing their wishes, aspirations and granting peace of mind.

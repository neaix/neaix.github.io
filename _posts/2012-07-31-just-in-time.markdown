There's a strategy often used in manufacturing industries called [Just In Time][1] production. 

As I'm both lazy and busier than I've ever been, I though I'd take a leaf out of the *just in time* book and apply it to web development. The result is this site.

##Contentedness

This site was intended to be a blog first, and a sandbox for my own design whims second. Before redesigning, the old site had it the other way round. The design was heavy, both in terms of file size and visual noise, and not enough attention given to content. 

As much as I liked how the site looked, it's lack of focus did nothing to encourage me to want to blog. Why bother, when the posts would be buried somewhere off the home page and covered in social "share" button bullshit?

###Content content content

With that in mind I began with a totally empty page and one rule, only add something if it really needs it. Or if it's really nice and doesn't get in the way of the content. Two rules. Also, no images. Three. Three rules.

    1. Does it help the content?
    2. Is it fun, and doesn't violate rule 1?

##Wait for it

I've been gradually adding bits here and there as they seem relevant, and holding back on anything that might get in the way of the content; [saying no][2], as Steve Jobs said.

I wanted some sort of identifying logo, but at the same time maintain focus on the site content. The best way, it seemed, was to have a simple but recognisable image. Something fun and not too serious, but not distracting either.

I considered adding a top navigation, but if I wanted to focus on the content first, a menu would be a distraction. No.

I considered adding a sidebar with photo and contact details, but, again, distraction. If you want to get in touch with me, it's not hard to find a way. So, again, No.

I considered a background image. I would certainly do something if it didn't violate rule 1, but for now, no.

As a result, this blog's a lot plainer looking than the previous version. Yet, I like it a lot more.

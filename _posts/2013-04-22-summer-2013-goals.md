Summer is coming, and this summer I would be doing an internship at Sunnyvale. The post title says **summer 2013 goals** and there is a reason behind it. I recently attended a talk and [Adam Cheyer](http://adam.cheyer.com) spoke. The summary of his talk was **"You can do more than you think you could do"**. So I am going to try something new, verbally state goals and try every bit to accomplish them. 

So my aim this summer is to accomplish all the below stated goals:

* Visit 50+ restaurants. No repeatations. Try and maximize the variety of cuisines.
* Hit the Gym everyday.
* Complete atleast one item in my [bucket list](http://pradeepnayak.in/bucket.html)
* Finish this [list](http://internproject.io/in-the-bay/Tourism/)
* Explore the Bay Area.
* Wine Tasting in Napa Valley.
* Finish reading one Novel.
* Work on a pet project.
* Stick to 9 to 5 routine :-)
* Complete a course in Coursera and don't leave it halfway.


Looking forward for an exciting summer!

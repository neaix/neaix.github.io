I came to the US in August 2012 for pursuing my masters in Computer Science at
USC. Since then, when not studying and working on my assignments I travelled.
I am writing this post because I want to tell a story and will do so using
pictures which I clicked while I travelled.

###I live in Los Angeles. So went and saw the Hollywood sign up-close.

##What I gained out of travelling ?

* Met amazing people, and made friends.
* Got a chance to explore different food cuisines.
* Completed some items on my [bucket](/bucket.html) list.
* Experienced different cultures.
* Learned to be more patient
* Learned to love life and make the best out of it.

and there are many more reasons. It just keeps me ticking.

>If you’re twenty-two, physically fit, hungry to learn and be better, I urge you to travel – as far and as widely as possible. Sleep on floors if you have to. Find out how other people live and eat and cook. Learn from them – wherever you go. ~ Anthony Bourdain

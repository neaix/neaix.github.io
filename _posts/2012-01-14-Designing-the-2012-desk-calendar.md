I took a nice vacation during the last week of December 2011. This was a completly unplanned trip and in the end it turned out to be awesome. During this time I visited the Banergatta Butterfly Park, Ranganatittu Bird Sanctuary and Ooty. I managed to click some wonderful pictures especially lots of Birds and Butterflies. I clicked all of them with my Cannon 500D and my new 55mm-250mm IS2 lens. I thought of monetizing my work. So I started the 2012 desk calendar project. I created a nice 6 x 4 desk calendar and the theme was "Birds and Butterflies". The calendar consists of 12 different types of Birds and Butterflies. I got them printed from [iTasveer](http://www.itasveer.com). I ordered around 25 calendars. I have managed to sell 12 calendars till now. The calendars are priced at 225/- (Shipping extra). You can find the design below. Do let me know if you need a copy ? Just drop me a mail at <pradeep1288@gmail.com> with your address where the calendar has to be shipped. I will reply you with my bank details so that you can transfer the money.

I have just been around 4 months in the US and I have already completed one semester at USC now. I took three courses this semester namely Operating Systems, Introduction to Computer Networks & Web Technologies. I got an opportunity to do interesting projects during this semester. I worked on building the weenix kernel and successfully built the scheduler, process & thread management blocks, Virtual File System and got a basic shell running. I also built a simple Android Application as part of my Web Technologies course. I relearned Computer Networks this semester. I never liked it in my undergraduate studies. But now I seem to like it, may be it was taught differently here. Apart from this I had a crazy amount of assignments to be submit and that along with 20 hours of work a week it was one hell of a semester. 

I have managed to perform quite well in my first semester and it is not as bad as I thought. I am now off to New York for my winter break and I am looking forward to celebrate New Year's at Times Square :-)

Wish you all a Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays!

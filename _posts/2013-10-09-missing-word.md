What is the best way to learn from the masters?

Look to the master, follow the master, walk with the master, see ____ the master, become the master. - Eric Steven Raymond

Missing Word contains more than 200 (and counting) hand-picked quotes. Every quote has a missing word. You need to think in the way as the master did, and figure out the missing word to complete the quote. Every time you finish a quote, not only have you read the quote, but also deeply understand it.

Learn from the masters, one quote at a time.

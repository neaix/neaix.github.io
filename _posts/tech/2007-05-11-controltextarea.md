[Control.TextArea](http://livepipe.net/projects/control_textarea/)的不同之初在于它支持Markdown、Textlite还有bbcode，一般的rte都是支持HTML。
> Decent, flexible WYSIWYG editing in the browser is still an inconsistent affair at best in terms of user experience, integration effort, and generated markup. In the meantime a crop of text formatting languages such as Markdown, Textile, BBCode and wiki markup have emerged as ways for users to enter rich content in a controlled fashion.

> Control.TextArea provides a toolbar for textareas where users are entering text in one of these markup languages. In addition to a toolbar it provides access to a cross browser text selection and manipulation API so that creating new functionality, or integration with your custom application features is vastly easier.

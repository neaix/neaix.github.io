A side effect of migrating across the world is the opportunity to look back at what I've done in the past, and sometimes it's equally encouraging to see how much things have changed, at the same time as how much has stayed the same. An example is the <a href="http://www.donovanhutchinson.com/msc">old coursework website I put together in 2002</a>.

When we were asked to put our coursework online, every other student made use of the faculty-provided hosting. While it didn't offer a huge amount of space, it was fast loading within the campus and free. It was also deleted every year. Perhaps just trying to be different, I put mine up on my own shared hosting in the USA. I'm glad I did, as it's interesting to look back and see how well (or badly) the work has aged.

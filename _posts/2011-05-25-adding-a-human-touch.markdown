We're all familiar with robots.txt, a standard way to direct the search engine bots to pages we want them to index. A site I stumbled across yesterday adds an interesting twist the idea by introducing a way to give the fleshy non-robotic contributors some love. <a href="http://humanstxt.org/">HumansTXT.org</a> is a simple idea, just a text file (humans.txt) added to the root of the site structure, which lists each person involved in a project along with a summary of what they do.

The humanstxt.org site includes the following instructions for getting set up:

<em>Create a text file called <strong>humans.txt</strong> (always in lower-case) and make it <strong>UTF-8</strong> encoded to avoid issues with special characters and multiple languages.</em>
<ol>
	<li><em>Place a reference to the file in the  of the site:</em></li>
	<li><em>For the sake of clarity and to keep a basic visual structure, you can use the headings /*TEAM*/ and /*SITE*/ to separate the human team from other information about the website.</em></li>
	<li><em>Include the following information about every human involved in the project: role, name, contact, twitter, geolocation, etc. Please be aware that you may have to deal with spam if you include email addresses.</em></li>
	<li><em>You can also include additional information about the site, such as the date of the last update (YYYY/MM/DD), its main language, its Doctype and other components, tools and software used on the development.</em></li>
	<li><em>Save the file and place it in your site root.</em></li>
	<li><em>Add the humansTXT button to your site and link it to your humansTXT file.</em></li>
</ol>
An <a href="http://humanstxt.org/humans.txt">example</a> can be found on their site.

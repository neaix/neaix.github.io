* <b>Google Summer of Code 2015 - RoboComp Tutorial, Social Management and Documentation.</b>

	Project Details : https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/rajathkumarmp/5707702298738688

* <b>Military Surveillance Bot</b>

	Project Details : http://esatjournals.net/ijret/2015v04/i07/IJRET20150407077.pdf

	Collaborators : Nishanth N. Bhonsle, Nitin R. Hugar

* <b>Fish on Wheels</b>

	Project Details : A fish is constrained to the boundaries of an aquarium. The position of the fish was estimated. The bot thus moved with respect to the movement of the fish.

* <b>Robotic Arm</b>

	Project Details : Using DC motors and Arduino built a pick and place robotic arm.

	Collaborators : Nishanth N. Bhonsle, Nitin R Hugar, Nikhil Nag

* <b>Self Balancing Bot</b>

	Project Details : Using PID controller, Arduino and servo motors the ball on beam is balanced. Using proximity sensor the exact location of the ball on the beam is being calculated relative to a already set point and is being given as input to the arduino. With respect to the the position of the ball the arduino drives the servo motors clockwise or anticlockwise and thereby balances the ball.

* <b>Air Drums</b>

	Project Details : Using accelerometer sensors fixed into two pvc pipes as drum sticks of suitable length a virtual drum kit is created. The movement of these sticks would trigger the interfaced arduino to produce an 8-bit code that acts as a lookup table code in the midi software for producing a particular note(snare or crash). The bass note is produced by wearing a sock onto which an ldr is fixed and by tapping our leg. The ldr senses the amount oflight falling on it and thereby produces the bass sound when the light falling on it is  reduced. The connections of the sensors and the interfacing of the arduino with midi software is done and a handy, portable, accurate drum kit is created.

* <b>2D visulaization of MPU6050 in Matlab</b>

	Project Details : MPU6050 is used to calculate the angle in space. This is inputted to the arduino which is interfaced with Matlab where the angle that is read by the arduino is visualized.

	Github Code : https://github.com/rajathkumarmp/Matlab-MPU6050-2DVisulization

* <b>MIDI Interfacing</b>

	Project Details : Interfaced electronic music instruments with arduino.

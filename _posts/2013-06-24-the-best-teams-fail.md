Ever since I started at my new job, I've been waiting for one thing -- to fail. 

I hate failing. But I've been looking forward to it. Why? 

*For our group to turn into a team.*

Now there's a big difference between people that work together and a team. 

When people are simply working together, things are opaque. The flow of information is asymmetrical, sporadic.  The group can often feel mercenary-like. Driven by self interest and/or fear. They very tangibly lack *trust* in each other.

This yields subpar work. When there's no trust, individuals act in self-interest. When people act in self-interest, the results of the group suffer.

A team is different. Things are transparent. People share thoughts, opinions, comments. Discussions become primarily strategic as opposed to tactical and consensus driven. The team moves from mercenary-like to missionary-like. Aligned by a single vision larger than any single person on the team. People *trust* each other.

This is the golden state. There is meaning behind the work. People are empowered and self motivated. Amazing things happen.

So how to build trust? There's 2 main ways -- success and failure.  

**Success**

Your team succeeds. You deliver a high quality product, you close a big deal, etc. You've proven that your team can do something right.

I call this ability trust. Whatever you did worked before, so make it work again. Morale is high, and you hope to boil down the last success into a formula and replicate.

But ability trust is contingent upon success. It all works great when things are going well. But when things go south, this can quickly evaporate. People start pointing fingers, and fear & self interest takes over. 

Ability trust is very ephemeral -- quickly won, but also very quickly lost. Teams need a more sustainable type of trust in conjunction with ability trust.

**Failure**

The opposite. Your team works on something together, and everything falls apart. 

1 of 2 things can happen. 1 -- the group turns on each other -- point fingers, spread blame, etc. A complete disaster. Or 2 -- the team will defend each other. 

Not defend failure. But prove that even in failure, they trust each other's decisions and will defend them. 'Because of XYZ, we thought this was best. It was the best decision possible at the time. We'll get it right next time.'

When you are knowingly wrong and your team sticks up for you, it instantly creates a bond. It becomes larger than just work output. The team believes in your ability, despite the outcome. You're free to take risks, learn, and improve as opposed to just trying to cover your ass.

A good team will have one of these. But a great team will have both.

**tl;dr**

Team > group of individual contributors. 

Trust turns individual contributors into a team.

To create trust, teams must survive either success or failure.

To create long term teams, they must survive both success and failure.

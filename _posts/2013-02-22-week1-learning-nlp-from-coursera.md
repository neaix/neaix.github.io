I am currently enrolled in to an [Natural Language Processing Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/nlangp) on Coursera. I just cant describe how awesome Coursera is, and that would be a separate blog post.


I just finished watching the Week 1 lectures and this is what I learned

* The language modelling problem
* Markov Processes
    * First order Markov Process
    * Second order Markov Process
* Unigram, Bigram and the Trigram models
* Evaluating Language Models: perplexity
* Estimation Techniques
    * Linear Interpolation
    * Discounting methods


I dedicate about 8 - 10 hours on average per week for my coursera class. I HOPE I manage to complete this course and all its assigments and programming projects in time. Stay tuned for further updates.

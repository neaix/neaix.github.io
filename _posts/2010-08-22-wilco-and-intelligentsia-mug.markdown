excerpt: Coffee + Wilco = impulse purchase.

I love Wilco. I also love Coffee. So when the coffee-connoisseurs <a href="http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com" target="_blank">Intelligentsia</a> teamed up with Chicago-based band, Wilco, to offer an exclusive Wilco/Intelligentsia co-branded mug, an impulse purchase was made.

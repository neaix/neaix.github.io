It's really difficult to tell the difference.

But when you check it in a different angle, you can tell the difference. Look at the hair of the monkey. The technology the genuine monkey stamp is engraving. You can see that very clear on the genuine one. One more thing is the paper on the fake one. The vertical waves on paper of the fake on can be only see in certian angle. But you will never see this on the genuine ones.

Fake monkey in different angle.

It cost me $30 to return the fake stamp to seller and get my money back. Hope this guide helpful to you and happy collecting stamps!

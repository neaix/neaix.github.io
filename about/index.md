I'm <em>Pankaj Kohli</em>. I am a security researcher based in Singapore. This is my place on the web since my previous domain name expired, and I'm trying to keep things simple since then. If you find anything interesting on this blog, drop me a message, and if you're lucky, I'll get back to you. :-)

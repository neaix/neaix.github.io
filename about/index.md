I did my computer science and engineering from [PES Institute of Technology](http://www.pes.edu), Bangalore. I worked for  [D E Shaw & Co](http://deshaw.com) for two years. Currently I'm pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at [University of Southern California](http://usc.edu), Los Angeles. My favourite editor is Vim and my favourite programming language is C. I know some python, perl, html, css, javascript and off late some C#. I use a MacBook Pro for most of my work. I also own a [Bose AE2](http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/audio_headphones/around_ear_headphones/index.jsp&perfsourceid=K9677&src=K9677) and use it with my Mac & iPad to listen to music. I listen to pretty much everything except heavy metal.

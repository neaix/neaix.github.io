      <a href="http://theweb.is"><img src="/images/case-studies/thewebis/thewebis.png" alt="The Web Is..." style="max-width:200px" width="100%" class="centered" /></a>
      <p><a href="http://theweb.is">The Web Is...</a> is a unique web conference taking place in Cardiff, Wales and timed to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the web.</p>
      <p>The website consisted of two parts, a promotional "teaser" site, and a full website for the conference.</p> 
      <h2>Teaser website</h2>
      <a href="http://theweb.is/teaser"><img src="/images/case-studies/thewebis/teaser.jpg" alt="The Web Is... teaser" class="wide" /></a>
      <p>Using modern CSS, and little JavaScript, <a href="http://theweb.is/teaser">The Web Is... teaser site</a> was designed to be as small as possible while still being graphically impressive. With 3D CSS animations, inline fonts and even a full Mac Plus emulator, the site is quite unique.</p>
      <h2>Full conference website</h2>
      <a href="http://theweb.is"><img src="/images/case-studies/thewebis/thewebis_homepage.jpg" alt="The Web Is..." class="wide" /></a>
      <p>Central to this responsive site was a long main page, giving information on each aspect of the conference. It builds on the visual themes of the teaser site, introducing a strong colour pallette and subtle animations. The aim was to create an air of quality, while allowing a bit of character and fun in.</p>

      <p>Craig Lockwood, founder and organiser, also runs Cardiff's Founders Hub, Besquare.me and other great resources. He has been a terrific client to work with.</p>

      <a href="http://converser.io"><img src="/images/case-studies/converser/converser_trans_logo_large.png" alt="Converser.io" style="max-width:400px" width="100%" class="centered" /></a>
      <p><a href="http://converser.io">Converser</a> provides an mobile app tool for businesses to create beautiful in-app messages.</p>
      <p>Working closely with the developers, I designed and built a consistently themed public website, blog site, and back-end software.</p> 
      <h2>Public website</h2>
      <a href="http://converser.io"><img src="/images/case-studies/converser/converser_homepage.jpg" alt="Converser.io homepage" class="wide" /></a>
      <p>The site is modern and light, using SVG graphics to ensure it looks pixel-perfect on high-resolution displays. It's also fast, and designed to work across all sizes of devices.</p>
      <h2>Converser Blog</h2>
      <a href="http://blog.converser.io"><img src="/images/case-studies/converser/converser_blog.jpg" alt="Converser.io homepage" class="wide" /></a>
      <p>The <a href="http://blog.converser.io">Converser blog</a> gives voice to the company, and offers insights into mobile development and trends. Set up as a Jekyll blog, it can be hosted anywhere, can withstand massive numbers of visitors without issue, and is a clean, light responsive design.
      <h2>Back-end</h2>
      <a href="http://converser.io"><img src="/images/case-studies/converser/converser_dashboard.jpg" alt="Converser dashboard" class="wide" /></a>
      <p>Keeping the spirit of friendliness, accessibility, and good design, the Converser back end aims to be both powerful and at the same time easy to use. With bright, clearly labelled actions and in-place editing of messages, the admin area is as likeable as it is useful.</p>

        </h4>
        <div id = "blog-content">
          <p>A little over a year ago, I joined <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18MuCue">Xpenser</a> -- a startup building expense management tools for individuals &amp; companies. We were 4 years old, bootstrapped, small (3 full time + interns), ~85K users and ~150 paying customers.</p>

<p>It was my first time building for businesses. I studied and learned about building product for businesses, how to sell, marketing, support, scaling, recruiting, etc.</p>

<p>About 6 months later, we were acquired by <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18Muzyn">Coupa</a>, a spend management company, to help run &amp; build upon their existing expense management business.</p>

<p>After we started at Coupa, I thought I'd be doing the same thing I was doing at Xpenser, but just at a different company. The setting would be different, but the goals were the same -- build the best expense management solution for businesses. At the time we joined, Coupa was 6 years old, had raised ~$50M in venture capital, ~150 people, and 400+ paying customers.</p>

<p>I was wrong. Even though both times we were solving the same problem &amp; selling to businesses, the lessons I learned didn't apply universally. We were no longer just selling to businesses, we were selling to the enterprise.</p>

<hr>


<p>As a student of the startup game, both times (at Xpenser &amp; Coupa) I went to the web to learn from founders/entrepreneurs. Both times I found little helpful information, and in many cases, what I did find turned out to just be plain wrong.</p>

<p>Traditionally there has been a veil that exists between what is said publicly and what is actually going on in a company. Recently, many startups have been favoring transparency over opacity, sharing valuable lessons and mistakes to the general public.</p>

<p>But the majority of startup advice I found on the web was directed at consumer startups. And that made sense -- for a business whose customers were other businesses you don't want your customers to read about, for example, how you screwed up and how their data wasn't properly protected. That kind of information will kill you in a sale. Opacity and boilerplate press releases were safer than an honest blog post that might come back to bite you in the ass.</p>

<p>So it's hard to find good information on the web for startups to learn about building for businesses. There's a lot of misunderstanding in the startup world about building for businesses -- the general sentiment and advice I hear seems to be repackaged consumer startup advice but in a business context.</p>

<p>After serving and building for all types of businesses at both Xpenser &amp; Coupa, I've learned a bit about the space, and I'll be sharing what I've learned here. <a href="http://eepurl.com/DdF7n">Click here to subscribe</a>!</p>

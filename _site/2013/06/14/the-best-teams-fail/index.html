        The Best Teams Fail
      </h1>
      <p class="muted">
        14 June 2013
      </p>
      <div id = "blog-content">
        <p>Ever since I started at Coupa, I've secretly been waiting for one thing -- to fail.</p>

<p>I <em>hate</em> failing. But strangely enough, I've been looking forward to it. Why?</p>

<p><em>For our team to bond.</em></p>

<p>Now first off, there's a big difference between people that work together and a team. They're pretty easy to spot.</p>

<p>When people are simply working together, things are opaque. The flow of information is asymmetrical, sporadic.  The group can often feel mercenary-like. Driven by self interest and/or fear. They very tangibly lack <em>trust</em> in each other.</p>

<p>This yields subpar work. When there's no trust, individuals act in self-interest. When people act in self-interest, the results of the group suffer.</p>

<p>A team is different. Things are transparent. People share thoughts, opinions, comments. Discussions become primarily strategic as opposed to tactical and consensus driven. The team moves from mercenary-like to missionary-like. Aligned by a single vision larger than any single person on the team. People <em>trust</em> each other.</p>

<p>This is the golden state. There is meaning behind the work. People are empowered and self motivated. Amazing things happen.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>The reason transparency is a such a powerful value for a companyâ€™s culture? It breeds trust, and trust is the foundation of great teamwork.</p>&mdash; Joel Gascoigne (@joelgascoigne) <a href="https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne/statuses/340499460696203264">May 31, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>So how to build trust? There's 2 main ways -- success and failure.</p>

<p><strong>Success</strong></p>

<p>So your team succeeds. You deliver a high quality product, you close a big deal, etc. You've proven that your team can do something right.</p>

<p>I call this ability trust. Whatever you did worked before, so let's make it work again. Morale is high, and you hope to boil down the last success into a formula and replicate.</p>

<p>But ability trust is contingent upon success. It all works great when things are going well. But things inevitably go south at some point, and this trust can quickly evaporate. People start pointing fingers, and self interest takes over.</p>

<p>Ability trust can be very ephemeral -- quickly won, but also very quickly lost. Teams need a more sustainable type of trust in conjunction with ability trust.</p>

<p><strong>Failure</strong></p>

<p>The opposite. You and your team work on something together, and everything falls apart.</p>

<p>When this happens, 1 of 2 things can happen. 1 -- the group turns on each other -- point fingers, spread blame, etc. A complete disaster. Or 2 -- the team will defend each other.</p>

<p>Not defend shitty decisions or failure. But prove that even in failure, they trust each other's decisions and will defend them. 'Because of XYZ, we thought this was best. It was the best decision possible at the time. We'll get it right next time.'</p>

<p>When you are knowingly wrong and your team sticks up for you, it instantly creates a bond. It becomes larger than just work output. The team believes in your ability, despite the outcome. You're free to take risks, learn, and improve as opposed to just trying to cover your ass.</p>

<p>A good team will have both types of trust. You can't have cultural trust without ability. Blindly sticking up for someone that can't produce is foolish. But throwing everyone on the team under the bus when things go wrong is also no good.</p>

<p>For new teams, I think the best way to develop both types of trust is to have a major success first, followed by a major failure. This will first create ability trust, then test it with cultural trust. If it passes, you'll have a good long term team.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<p>Team > group of individual contributors.</p>

<p>Trust turns individual contributors into a team.</p>

<p>To create trust, teams must survive either success or failure.</p>

<p>Teams can be short term. To create long term teams, they must survive both success and failure.</p>

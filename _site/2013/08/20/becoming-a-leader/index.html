          The First Step To Becoming A Leader

          <p>What is a leader?</p>

<p>A leader is someone who drives a group of people towards a common goal.</p>

<p>Leaders come in all different flavors, but the best leaders all have a few things in common -- they have a clear vision and they are the drivers that push it all forward.</p>

<p>So what does it take to become a leader? Charisma, salesmanship, product sense, etc. are all pieces of it, but not the key element. At the core, a leader is someone who simply makes good decisions for the group.</p>

<hr>


<p>I believe that everyone knows what a good decision looks like. People either explicitly know what it is, or they are able to "feel" when a decision is right. Intuition is still always there as a fail safe.</p>

<p>Then why isn't everyone a leader?</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, most people don't speak their minds. They stifle their own voice and default to the majority. The majority must know better, be smarter, have more experience, etc. This can be especially true if you're in a group full of people smarter than you.</p>

<p>To become a leader, all you have to do is start speaking your mind. That simple.</p>

<p>Speaking your mind is how you learn. You force yourself to have an opinion, take a side, and voice it publicly. If you're consistently right, people will recognize this and you will quickly evolve into the decision making authority and leader.</p>

<p>But when you speak up, you might not always be right. In fact, when you start to really speak your mind, there's a good chance you'll often be wrong. When this happens, it can certainly be easy to hide behind silence.</p>

<p>If you're wrong, people might call you an idiot. And in the short term, you might actually feel like an idiot.</p>

<p>But it doesn't matter. When you put yourself out there, you expose your actual thoughts. You create a voice for yourself as well as subjecting your thought process to criticism.</p>

<p>Take in the criticism, recalibrate, and try again. You can tweak what was wrong before, and constantly iterate your thought process to success.</p>

<p>When you say nothing, you never put yourself out there. By not exposing what you think, you never challenge your own thought process, your ideas, and your beliefs. It's easier to hide behind silence than subject yourself to the risk of ridicule. Over time, however, those that speak out will continue to improve and others will remain static.</p>

<p>After constantly interating and optimizing your thought process, you'll start to hone your instincts and begin making the right decisions. By this point you'll have a voice for yourself in the group, have confidence in your opinions, and have naturally evolved into a leader for your group.</p>

<hr>


<p>I've typically been pretty outspoken. And while this might all seem like common sense, I found that once I started paying attention to myself, I realized I was subconsciously defaulted to the majority on a several things that I actually had an opinions on.</p>

<p>I caught myself and changed my behavior, but I wouldve never realized that I was keeping quiet until I started to explicitly watch my own behavior.</p>

<p>Give it a shot, would love to hear thoughts or if you've had a similar experience.</p>

## Author information

To have author bylines and bio at bottom of posts, add configuration like the following in `_config.yml`:

```yml
authors:
  johndoe:
    name: John Doe
    website: https://github.com/barepants
    bio: An awesome bio # Author info at bottom of post only shows if bio exists
    avatar: /crossing-jekyll/images/avatar.jpg
```

and specify the author in the Front Matter of posts:

    ---
    author: johndoe
    ---


## Social meta tags

Crossing generates [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) meta tags automatically for better social media sharing. There are two extra settings:

```yml
# _config.yml
og_image: /images/og-image.jpg # Fallback og:image when no page.image or site.image. at least 200 x 200px.
twitter_site: # twitter:site. Your Twitter username without "@"
```

### Meta description

`page.excerpt` is used for meta description of posts and pages. It is the first paragraph by default for posts. For pages you have to set it in the Front Matter:

    ---
    excerpt: An excerpt
    ---

Twitter Cards requires meta description. Facebook could infer it from the page if it's empty.

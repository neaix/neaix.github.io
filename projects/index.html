        <h1>The Web Is...</h1>
        <p><a href="http://theweb.is">The Web Is...</a> is a unique web conference taking place in Cardiff, Wales and timed to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the web.</p>
        <p>The website consisted of two parts, a <a href="http://theweb.is/teaser">promotional "teaser" site</a>, and a full website for the conference.</p>
        <p>Using modern CSS, and little JavaScript, <a href="http://theweb.is/teaser">the teaser site</a> was designed to be as small as possible while still being graphically impressive. With 3D CSS animations, inline fonts and even a full Mac Plus emulator, the site is quite unique.</p>
        <p>The main site builds on the visual themes of the teaser site, introducing a strong colour pallette and subtle animations. The aim was to create an air of quality, while allowing a bit of character and fun.</p>
        <p><strong>My role:</strong> I worked directly with Craig to brainstorm, plan, build and deliver both sites.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Advanced HTML/CSS, web fonts, Grunt.js, Middleman</p>
